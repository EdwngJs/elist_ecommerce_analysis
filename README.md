## Background
Founded in 2018, **TechTronics is an e-commerce company that sells popular electronics products** and has since expanded to a global customer base. Like most e-commerce companies, Elist sells products through their online site as well as through their mobile app. They use a variety of marketing channels to reach customers, including Email campaigns, SEO, and affiliate links. Over the last few years, their more popular products have been products from Apple, Samsung, and ThinkPad.

The company has a core dataset consisting of orders, order statuses, customers, products, and geographic information. Their data is quite messy and contains plenty of insights that have not yet been discovered by the company.  The project goal is to deliver insights to teams across the company, including finance, sales, product, and marketing. Your focus is to help these stakeholders understand TechTronicsâ€™s performance so they can improve their day-to-day processes and help the company deliver top-notch products to customers around the world.
